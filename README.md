Textile Inventory Management System (CSV Version)

üßæ Project Description:
This is a desktop-based inventory management system designed for textile businesses to efficiently track product stock.

View All Products:
Displays all the inventory records in a structured table format using a Treeview. Users can refresh the data to load the latest records from the CSV file.

Statistics (Stats):
Automatically calculates and displays total received products, total sold, and current stock in hand. This helps in keeping track of inventory levels in real time.
